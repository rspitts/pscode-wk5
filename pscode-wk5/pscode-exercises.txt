// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

var a
var b

a + b

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

int a
if int a%2 == 0 then even, else odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

var myArray [1,2,3,4,5]

var sum = 0. As long as int i= 0, 0 < myArray.Length, i++, then add the element to the sum. Finally, sum / myArray.Count()

Array.Sort(myArray), 
int smallest = myArray.First(), 
int largest = myArray.Last()
